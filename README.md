# Bid-Resources-for-Copilot

This repository is designed to serve as a centralized knowledge source for planning and writing bids, proposals, and related documents. It is intended for integration with Microsoft Copilot Agent, enabling smart search and interrogation of various file types.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`/docs/`**  
  Contains Word (`.docx`), Excel (`.xlsx`), and PDF (`.pdf`) files.  
  Use this folder to store reference documents, data sheets, reports, and other supporting materials.

- **`/websites/`**  
  Includes saved web pages (HTML, PDF), annotated URL lists, and web snapshots.  
  Add relevant online resources, competitor sites, or research links here.

- **`/templates/`**  
  Houses bid templates, sample proposals, checklists, and reusable document formats.  
  Use this folder to maintain standardized materials for future bids.

- **`/notes/`**  
  Stores Markdown (`.md`) or plain text notes.  
  Use for brainstorming, meeting minutes, action lists, or summarizing key learnings.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Adding Files:**  
   - Upload relevant documents into the appropriate folders.
   - For new folders, create them as needed using the GitHub UI or locally before pushing.

2. **File Naming:**  
   - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `Customer_Requirements_v2.docx`, `Data_Analysis_2024.xlsx`, `Competitor_Review.pdf`).
   - Include dates or version numbers for clarity.

3. **Metadata (Optional):**  
   - You may add an index file (e.g., `index.json`, `meta.yaml`) to summarize document content for easier search and retrieval by Copilot Agent.

4. **Copilot Agent Integration:**  
   - Ensure files are accessible and not password-protected.
   - Maintain consistent structure for optimal search and AI-powered interrogation.
